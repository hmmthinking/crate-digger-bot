# crate-digger-bot
A Discord bot that gets data from the Discogs API.

This is a personal project that I'm working on to keep my JS skills sharp. I'm not sure if other pure Discogs bots exist out there.
This is very much a rough, unfinished product.
If you want to use this on your own machine, you will have to generate a config.json file with a preferred prefix, token, discogs key, and discogs secret.
